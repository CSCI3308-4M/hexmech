<h1>Starting a Game</h1>
<p>HexMech is a game with relatively complicated mechanics. Fortunately, you don't have to read a complicated rulebook just to try it out! The basic premise of the game is this: You are piloting a mech and trying to kill your enemy's mech. You can walk, run, and jump with your mech. You can shoot lasers or bullets. Using your lasers or bullets heats up your mech and if you use them too much your mech will overheat and die.</p>
<p>When you start your first game, we recommend selecting the "Distant Glen" map. This map is mostly meadow, but with a single river running most of the way through the middle. It will help you understand the basic strategy without being overwhelmed by terrain details.</p>
<h1>Playing the Game</h1>
<p>Try walking, running, and jumping with your mech. You'll notice the distance allowed for each movement type differs. You'll also notice that you can only move forwards and backwards. You have to turn your mech in the direction you want to travel if you'd like to go to the side. When your mech is moving, it's a bit more vulnerable to damage but it's harder to hit. Running has a greater effect in both ways than walking. Jumping isn't really necessary on the Distant Glen map because terrain heights aren't different enough. Some maps have big changes in terrain height on adjacent tiles; that's why jumping is necessary. </p>
<p>Try firing your laser towards your enemy's mech. Did you hit it? You'll notice as you play the game more that being closer to the enemy mech gives your laser a much higher chance to hit it. Lasers can travel across the map, but your regular guns have a more limited range.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
