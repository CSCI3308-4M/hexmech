## Description
BattleTech is a turn-based strategy board game in which players command 1 or
more BattleMechs (mechanized suits of armor represented by figurines) in
combat on a game board.  We hope to create an online version of the game in
which users can play against each other and enjoy all of the same features as
the introductory rules to the board game.


## Vision Statement

> Crushing metal with every commit.


## Motivation
BattleTech is currently played in person with charts, sheets, and very many
dice rolls, or it is played using the MegaMek application.  Playing in person
is difficult because fans of BattleTech are not always located in clusters.
Furthermore, playing BattleTech by hand can be very tedious, especially for
new players who don't know all the rules.  The other option is the MegaMek
application which is Java based and suffers from an overly complicated
interface using multiple windows.  The intention of HexMech is to make
BattleTech more accessible by:
* Using a browser only client requiring no installation.
* Hiding the complexities of the math behind a game of BattleTech.
* Informing players of the rules only when they try to break them.
* Increasing the speed of the game and also allowing correspondence style games
  which will reduce time commitment to play.
* Providing an easy to install server.
* And finally, establishing a platform that could allow a community of players
  to assemble and play in a unified location and possibly be expanded in the
  future to an in game economy/persistent universe.


## Risks
* JavaScript (both client side and node.js) are relatively new to all members
  of the team.
* Most of the team has never written a game before.
* The team has never worked together before.
* We have few times that everyone is free each week.
* BattleTech is relatively new to all of our members.
* We don't have any experience with rendering graphics in HTML5.
* The hex grid required by BattleTech poses some difficulty in storage and
  calculations.
* Not completing an entire set of rules.

### Mitigation
* A running start with the rules of BattleTech is helping with understanding
  the features needed.  Also, one of our members knows many fans of BattleTech
  who can answer questions related to the game rules themselves.
* Using industry standard libraries such as jQuery, ExpressJS, socket.io, and
  possibly pixi.js should make the transition to JavaScript easier.
* The article at [Hexegon Grids](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons)
  should provide ample documentation on how to store and perform calculations on
  hex grids.
* There are many rules we can cut out for time if we need to and still have
  a functional product.  This is one of the main reasons we have chosen the
  Agile project methodology.
* We do have some experience in graphics design and programming.

## Methodology

We will be using the Agile methodology when applicable and only dipping into
a Waterfall like approach when a common design must be established between the
back and front ends.


## Project Tracking Software
* Our team will be using Trello as our Project Tracking Software.
* Link:

## Project Plan

Major deliverable: Functional HexMech browser game.  
Methodology: Our four-person team will split into two pairs that work closely together. One pair will focus on the backend and one will focus on frontend. The frontend team will also handle the graphics.  
As soon as a playable version is created, the team will test it by playing it with each other and by playing it with others.   Feedback will be collected to help refine requirements and discover errors.  
Subsequent testing will be done at least once a week to ensure new features and bugfixes are not detrimental.  
The team will use Trello to track user stories.
