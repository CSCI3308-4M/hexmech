## Description
BattleTech is a turn-based strategy board game in which players command 1 or
more BattleMechs (mechanized suits of armor represented by figurines) in
combat on a game board.  We hope to create an online version of the game in
which users can play against each other and enjoy all of the same features as
the introductory rules to the board game.


## Vision Statement

Crushing metal with every commit.


## Motivation

BattleTech is currently played in person with charts, sheets, and very many
dice rolls, or it is played using the MegaMek application.  Playing in person
is difficult because fans of BattleTech are not always located in clusters.
Furthermore, playing BattleTech by hand can be very tedious, especially for
new players who don't know all the rules.  The other option is the MegaMek
application which is Java based and suffers from an overly complicated
interface using multiple windows.  The intention of HexMech is to make
BattleTech more accessible by:
* Using a browser only client requiring no installation.
* Hiding the complexities of the math behind a game of BattleTech.
* Informing players of the rules only when they try to break them.
* Increasing the speed of the game and also allowing correspondence style games
  which will reduce time commitment to play.
* Providing an easy to install server.
* And finally, establishing a platform that could allow a community of players
  to assemble and play in a unified location and possibly be expanded in the
  future to an in game economy/persistent universe.


## Risks
.JavaScript and Python are relatively new languages to some members, and the team is new to working together
.Mitigation: We will need to get up to speed quickly with newer languages and work together to ensure that the code is efficient.
